# ADR-008: Use Pytest-BDD for BDD Testing

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Pytest-BDD is a plugin for Pytest that allows for behavior-driven development (BDD) testing. It provides a way to write tests in a natural language style, which can improve communication between developers and non-developers.

## Decision
We will use Pytest-BDD for BDD testing in this project. This includes setting up Pytest-BDD configuration and writing test cases using the BDD style.

## Consequences
- Tests will be written in a natural language style, improving communication.
- Developers need to be familiar with Pytest-BDD and BDD principles.
- Pytest-BDD configuration will need to be maintained as the project evolves.
