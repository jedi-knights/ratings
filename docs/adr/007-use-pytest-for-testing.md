# ADR-007: Use Pytest for Testing

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Pytest is a mature full-featured Python testing tool that helps write simple and scalable test cases. It supports fixtures, parameterized testing, and has a rich plugin architecture.

## Decision
We will use Pytest for testing in this project. This includes setting up Pytest configuration and writing test cases using Pytest's features.

## Consequences
- Tests will be easier to write and maintain.
- Developers need to be familiar with Pytest and its features.
- Pytest configuration will need to be maintained as the project evolves.
