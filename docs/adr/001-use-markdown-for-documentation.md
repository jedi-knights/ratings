# ADR-001: Use Markdown for Documentation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is easy to write and read, and it can be converted to various formats such as HTML and PDF. Using Markdown for documentation ensures that the documentation is easy to maintain and version control.

## Decision
We will use Markdown for all project documentation. This includes README files, architecture decision records (ADRs), and any other relevant documentation.

## Consequences
- Documentation will be easy to write and maintain.
- Documentation can be easily converted to other formats.
- Contributors need to be familiar with Markdown syntax.
