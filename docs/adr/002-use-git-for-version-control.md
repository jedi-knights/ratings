# ADR-002: Use Git for Version Control

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously. It provides powerful branching and merging capabilities, making it easier to manage changes and collaborate on code.

## Decision
We will use Git for version control in this project. This includes using Git for tracking changes, branching, merging, and collaborating with other developers.

## Consequences
- Version control will be distributed, allowing for better collaboration.
- Branching and merging will be more efficient.
- Developers need to be familiar with Git commands and workflows.
