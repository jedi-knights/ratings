# ADR-004: Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are essential practices in modern software development. GitHub Actions is a powerful automation tool that allows developers to create custom workflows for CI/CD directly within their GitHub repositories. It integrates seamlessly with GitHub, providing a streamlined experience for building, testing, and deploying code.

## Decision
We will use GitHub Actions for CI/CD in this project. This includes setting up workflows for automated testing, building, and deployment processes.

## Consequences
- CI/CD processes will be integrated directly with our GitHub repository.
- Automated workflows will improve code quality and deployment efficiency.
- Developers need to be familiar with GitHub Actions syntax and configuration.
